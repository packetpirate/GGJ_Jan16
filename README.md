## Description
In Cutie Thief, you play a young girl who wants some cuties to call her very own -- but the mean old farmer wouldn’t give her any! Go take that farmer’s cuties! 

You must collect all the animals in the level and deposit them in the fenced off area while protecting them from the mean old wolves who want to eat the cuties and the farmers who will try to stop you from stealing their cuties! 

Use the WASD keys to move.
